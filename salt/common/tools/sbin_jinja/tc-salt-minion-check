# this script checks the time the file /opt/tc/log/salt/state-apply-test was last modified and restarts the salt-minion service if it is outside a threshold date/time
# the file is modified via file.touch using a scheduled job healthcheck.salt-minion.state-apply-test that runs a state.apply. 
# by default the file should be updated every 5-8 minutes. 
# this allows us to test that the minion is able apply states and communicate with the master
# if the file is unable to be touched via the state.apply, then we assume there is a possibilty that the minion is hung (though it could be possible the master is down as well)
# we then stop the service, pkill salt-minion, the start the salt-minion service back up
