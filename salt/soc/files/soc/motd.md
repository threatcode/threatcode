## Getting Started

New to Security Onion 2? Click the menu in the upper-right corner and you'll find links for [Help](/docs/) and a [Cheat Sheet](/docs/cheatsheet.pdf) that will help you best utilize Security Onion to hunt for evil! In addition, check out our free Security Onion 2 Essentials online course, available on our [Training](https://threatcodesolutions.com/training) website.

If you're ready to dive in, take a look at the [Alerts](/#/alerts) interface to see what Security Onion has detected so far. Then go to the [Dashboards](/#/dashboards) interface for a general overview of all logs collected or go to the [Hunt](/#/hunt) interface for more focused threat hunting. Once you've found something of interest, escalate it to [Cases](/#/cases) to then collect evidence and analyze observables as you work towards closing the case.
